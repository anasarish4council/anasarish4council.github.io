            Boots On The Ground For 20 Years
            </h2>
            <p>
              Raising my boys and working in this beautiful city for over twenty years, I have
              actively advocated for local businesses, our families, and schools. I've been honored to
              serve on several city committies, as well as helping to renew the police levy to maintain 
              a healthy balance between growth and security. As our city continues to expand, my vision
              is to help facilitate growth in such a way that I preserve the history and livability of our
              city, with an eye towards a fiscally conservative future. I am excited for the opportunity
              to serve as your City Councilor, and I humbly ask for your vote. 
            </p>

            <a type="button" class="btn btn-warning" href="mailto:?subject=Support Ana Sarish For Council&body=It’s vital that we vote our values, so I’ll be voting for Ana Sarish for Happy Valley City Council this Fall. Ana is an advocate for public safety, managing growth and for expanding economic opportunity in our community. She also devotes a significant amount of time and effort working in the community through city committees, school boards, business alliance and charity organizations for youth. Her experience on several city committees, including the Happy Valley Traffic and Safety Committee, means she understands how local government works – and doesn’t . She can hit the ground running on day one of her term. I especially appreciate Ana's thoughtful leadership. She seeks out new ideas and different perspectives, weighs the alternatives, considers possible outcomes and develops reasonable positions. She’s approachable and engaged, and genuinely committed to advancing the needs of Happy Valley. Ana will bring a fresh voice to our council.  Please join me in voting for Ana Sarish for City Council.

P.S.
Please make sure you vote the whole ballot!  Many voters miss voting for city positions.

Thank you!
